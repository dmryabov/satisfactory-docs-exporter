Satisfactory Docs Exporter - An alternative Docs.json implementation
---

### Usage:

SatisfactoryDocsExporter is a console .NET applicaton.
[.NET Runtime 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
or later is required. Windows and Linux are both supported, macOS might work too.

Prebuilt binaries are available on
[Releases](https://github.com/dmryabov/satisfactory-docs-exporter/releases) page.

Build-in help can be printed by running `SatisfactoryDocsExporter.exe`
with `--help` option:

```
$ ./SatisfactoryDocsExporter --help
Description:
  Parser of Satisfactory game's data files to JSON database.

Usage:
  SatisfactoryDocsExporter [options]

Options:
  -d, --game-dir <game-dir>  Path to Satisfactory game directory where FactoryGame.exe is located [default: ..]
  -o, --output <output>      Path to output JSON file. [default: Docs.json]
  -?, -h, --help             Show help and usage information
```

To export Docs.json with default options:

1. Place SatisfactoryDocsExporter directory inside Satisfactory's game directory
   (next to FactoryGame.exe file).
2. Open Terminal app in SatisfactoryDocsExporter directory.
3. Start SatisfactoryDocsExporter.exe.
4. Wait for operation to complete. Progress is displayed in Terminal's output.
5. SatisfactoryDocsExporter directory should contain Docs.json file with all exported data.

### Motivation:

Satisfactory already provides Docs.json file with various info about
recipes, buildables and other items. But those who try to parse such file
might face following issues:

* A lot of different native classes without exposed hierarchy. There are
  30+ classes extending base `FGItemDescriptor` class. To find all item
  descriptors manual class mapping needed.
* Some properties are missing, for example `mBuildableClass` in
  `FGBuildDescriptor`, which makes it impossible to link it to
  corresponding `FGBuildable` class without heuristics and manual mapping.
* Map and Array properties are using custom encoding format, so
  additional lexer/parser needed on top of JSON decoder.
* Other small inconveniences, such as inconsistent class name encoding,
  missing game version field, etc...

Docs.json generated by SatisfactoryDocsExporter has similar structure to the
original one, but resolves these issues. Here's an example of exported class:

```json
[
  {
    "NativeClass": "FGCustomizationRecipe",
    "NativeClassChain": [
      "FGCustomizationRecipe",
      "FGRecipe"
    ],
    "Class": "BlueprintGeneratedClass'FactoryGame/Content/FactoryGame/Buildable/-Shared/Customization/Patterns/Icons/Recipe_Pattern_Icon_Cart.Recipe_Pattern_Icon_Cart_C'",
    "Name": "Recipe_Pattern_Icon_Cart_C",
    "Type": "BlueprintGeneratedClass",
    "Properties": {
      "mCustomizationDesc": {
        "Class": "BlueprintGeneratedClass'FactoryGame/Content/FactoryGame/Buildable/-Shared/Customization/Patterns/Icons/PatternDesc_Icon_Cart.PatternDesc_Icon_Cart_C'",
        "Name": "PatternDesc_Icon_Cart_C",
        "Type": "BlueprintGeneratedClass"
      },
      "mDisplayName": "Test Pattern 6",
      "mIngredients": [
        {
          "ItemClass": {
            "Class": "BlueprintGeneratedClass'FactoryGame/Content/FactoryGame/Resource/Parts/ColorCartridge/Desc_ColorCartridge.Desc_ColorCartridge_C'",
            "Name": "Desc_ColorCartridge_C",
            "Type": "BlueprintGeneratedClass"
          },
          "Amount": 1
        }
      ],
      "mProducedIn": [
        {
          "Class": "BlueprintGeneratedClass'FactoryGame/Content/FactoryGame/Equipment/BuildGun/BP_BuildGun.BP_BuildGun_C'",
          "Name": "BP_BuildGun_C",
          "Type": "BlueprintGeneratedClass"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
